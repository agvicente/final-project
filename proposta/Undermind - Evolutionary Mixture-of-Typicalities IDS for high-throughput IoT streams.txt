Research Report on

Evolutionary Mixture-of-Typicalities IDS for high-throughput IoT
streams
Full search query: I want to find research on anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) for IoT that use evolutionary clustering approaches—especially mixture of typicalities—within high-throughput, cloud-based stream architectures (like Kafka). I am interested in both conceptual/theoretical models and empirical implementations. Highly relevant works address real-time data streams, adaptive models for concept drift and class
imbalance, computational efficiency for edge deployment, and benchmarks against classical IDS under metrics like accuracy, false positive rate,
latency, and scalability

Summary
No paper in this literature set directly implements a Mixture of Typicalities (MoT)-based evolutionary clustering anomaly IDS for
IoT within a high-throughput streaming architecture (Kafka/Spark) addressing real drift, class imbalance, and edge constraints; the
closest approach is [1], which uses Bayesian possibilistic clustering with online adaptation, but without full joint typicality-membership
optimization or true stream/cloud deployment.

Main Findings Relative to Search Criteria
1. Mixture of Typicalities and Evolutionary Clustering
• No references implement the Mixture of Typicalities (MoT) framework in the sense of joint optimization of membership and
typicality for clustering in streaming IoT IDS.
• [1] uses an online Bayesian possibilistic clustering module, providing some robustness to outliers and drift, but typicality is not
jointly optimized with membership as in MoT, and it lacks explicit streaming/cloud infrastructure.
• All other papers ([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]) rely on standard or incremental clustering/classification without MoT or focus on
fuzzy/possibilistic approaches only loosely related to the joint objective of MoT.

2. Streaming/Cloud-Based High-Throughput Architectures
• Several works ([2,3,5,6,7,8,10]) implement or benchmark their IDS in genuine streaming environments, leveraging Apache
Kafka and Spark (or similar distributed data stream frameworks).
• [6,7,8,10] indicate strong focus on scalability, throughput, and latency in distributed IDS, but do not use evolutionary or
typicality-based clustering (favoring incremental trees, KMeans, or hybrid ML pipelines).

3. IoT-Specific Evaluation and Datasets
• [1] and [5] use real IoT data sources; [2,3,4] include IoT-specific datasets (Bot-IoT, IoT-23, NF-ToN-IoT-v2, etc.), although only
[1] and [5] are explicit about true device/protocol heterogeneity and streaming ground truth.
• Many other studies repurpose general IDS datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15), which may have limited IoT diversity.

4. Concept Drift and Class Imbalance
• Concept drift adaptation is addressed in [1,2,3,4,9]:
• [1]: Adaptive possibilistic clustering and online fuzzy ensemble adjust to drift.
• [2,3,4]: Explicit drift detectors and retraining for DDoS/malware streaming IDS.
• [9]: Black-box adaptation and explanation in streaming AIoT.
• Class imbalance mitigation is largely unaddressed (no reference uses the MoT objective or minority reweighting at the
clustering level). Most works rely on post-hoc resampling or mention imbalance as a challenge.

5. Computational Efficiency and Edge/Resource Constraints
• Edge or low-resource deployment claims are largely unquantified.
• [5] emphasizes a fog/edge context but provides no concrete CPU, RAM, or energy usage results.
• Others focus on cloud/cluster resource scaling ([2,6,8,10]) with attention to throughput but not lightweight, IoT-embedded
constraints.

• [1] compares against traditional/ML competitors for accuracy and stability, but not real-time classical IDS (e.g., Snort) in
streaming cloud setups.
• [6,7,8,10] provide accuracy, F1, and throughput under substantial streaming loads, but omit advanced clustering, drift, or
typicality mechanisms.
• Benchmarks versus signature-based IDS in a streaming/IoT/cloud context are rare.

Gaps and Research Opportunities
• No work unifies MoT, evolutionary clustering, streaming cloud deployment, IoT heterogeneity, and edge efficiency.
• [1] advances streaming fuzzy clustering and ensemble adaptation, but does not implement MoT or a cloud-scale pipeline.
• Most stream/edge/cloud IDS ([2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10]) do not use fuzzy or typicality-based clustering.
• Concept drift adaptation is now a research norm; integration with advanced clustering (MoT) is not.
• Edge metrics (CPU/RAM/energy) and class imbalance mitigation in high-throughput IoT IDS remain critically underexplored.

Recommended Resources for Further Study
• Closest conceptual match: [1] – for fuzzy/possibilistic online clustering and streaming IoT IDS, though without MoT or
streaming cloud architecture.
• Strong streaming implementation and drift detection (standard ML): [2,3,6,7,8,10].
• Best real-time distributed IDS pipeline with throughput benchmarks: [8].
• State-of-the-art concept drift adaptation (non-clustering): [9].
• IoT-specific testbeds/pipelines without advanced clustering: [5].

Narrative Analysis by Key Dimension
1. Evolutionary Clustering and Typicality/MoT Use
• Closest to Desired MoT: Only [1] applies a soft/fuzzy approach with an online possibilistic (but not mixture-of-typicalities)
clustering module; typicality (belief) is present, but not jointly optimized with membership as in MoT.
• Pure Evolutionary Clustering: [4] presents incremental (cluster) adaptation with density thresholding–but does not use
fuzzy/typicality or possibilistic extensions.
• Rest: Most (e.g., [2,3,5,6,7,8,10]) employ either classifiers or batch-trained clustering; their streaming early detection relies on
online learning or micro-batching rather than on incremental centroid updating with fading/micro-clusters.

2. Streaming/Cloud Architectures
• Kafka/Spark Used Explicitly: [2,3,5,6,7,8,10] embody real streaming pipeline elements (Kafka ingestion, Spark/Flink for
analytics), from “exactly-once” streaming to large distributed settings.
• [3,8,10] provide strongest coupling to real cloud-scale stream processing.
• [6] for incremental learning and [7] blend Kafka with standard big-data ML tools.
• Simulation Only: [4,1] are implemented in local Python/online frameworks—less relevant to true production-grade stream
settings.
3. IoT Context and Datasets
• Strongest IoT Relevance: [1] (real IoT system traffic), [5] (NF-ToN-IoT-v2 from actual IoT sources), [2,3] (although using
NSL-KDD/IoT-23: mixed edge/IoT, not always strongly heterogeneous).
• Most Others: DDoS focus or NSL-KDD/UNSW (used in [4])—not always involving highly heterogeneous, resource-constrained
IoT protocols.
4. Concept Drift & Class Imbalance Handling
• Concept Drift
• Addressed Explicitly: [1] (fully incremental/fuzzy ensemble), [2] (online retraining under unsupervised drift detection),
[3] (six drift detectors compared in streaming context), [4] (on-the-fly clustering updates).
• Not Explicit: [5,6,7,8,10]—some use standard updates or periodic retraining, not sophisticated drift adaptation.
• Class Imbalance
• Only [1] describes robust unfamiliar pattern detection/cluster emergence; none describe oversampling/minority reweighting at the MoT-objective or centroid level.
5. Computational Efficiency/Edge Deployment
• Edge/Resource-Aware: [5] is “Fog” oriented, but does not present quantified CPU/memory results.
• Most Others focus on cloud/cluster throughput ([2,3,6,7,8,10]), with streaming throughput but lacking low-power or embedded-deployment numbers.
• [1]: Online, but missing actual edge benchmarks or model-compression results.
6. Benchmarks (Latency, FPR, Classical IDS, Scalability)
• Comprehensive Streaming Benchmarks: [3,6,7,8,10] all provide streaming accuracy, >10^4 events/sec, and sometimes
F1/FPR. [8,10] especially emphasize throughput and low latency.
• Classical IDS comparison: [1] reports comparison to “numerous competitors” (not clearly naming Snort/Suricata), typically
academic ML baselines.
• Scalability (Horizontal): Stressed in [2,6,8,10] via distributed cluster implementation (Kafka/Spark).
• Latency, FPR Quantification: [4] (7.9% FPR on NSL-KDD), [6] (latency optim, throughput), [7,8,10] focus on throughput/latency but sometimes omit explicit latency budget.

Key Takeaways for Domain Experts
• No paper in this set directly implements a Mixture of Typicalities (MoT) clustering model within a Kafka/Spark-based
streaming pipeline for IoT intrusion detection.
• [1] comes closest: online fuzzy/possibilistic methods, but not joint membership-typicality MoT.
• Streaming architectures are robustly adopted ([2,3,5,6,7,8,10]), but the combination with evolutionary clustering (not just
online classifiers) is rare.
• Concept drift is increasingly addressed (esp. [1,2,3,4,9]), yet integration with true online fuzzy-typicality models and rigorous
class imbalance mitigation is largely absent.
• Benchmarks are cloud/throughput focused; explicit comparisons to traditional signature-based IDS in a streaming context
are rare.
• Edge/IoT deployment constraints are not well studied in terms of quantifiable resource metrics, except for Fog-contextual mentions ([5]); most papers focus on scalability for cloud/distributed nodes.
• IoT traffic and datasets are sometimes present ([1,2,3,5]), but heterogeneity (protocols/devices) and ground-truth alignment
for streaming benchmarks remain spotty.

Conclusion: Gaps and Unique Contributions
• Almost no intersection of MoT theory, evolutionary clustering, Kafka-scale streaming, and IoT/edge benchmarking exists in
these papers. [1] is the most conceptually relevant for online typicality-based clustering, but lacks both explicit MoT and scalable
streaming/cloud deployment.
• Streaming IDS research in IoT leans towards online classifiers or batch-updated clustering, with fuzzy/possibilistic
methods underrepresented in large-scale cloud pipelines.
• Future work should unify MoT (or similar robust fuzzy clustering) with real streaming architectures, true IoT workloads,
and end-to-end performance metrics including edge and cloud deployment.

Timeline
Timeline and Development of Anomaly-based IDS for IoT with Evolutionary Clustering and Stream
Architectures
1. Early Evolutionary and Fuzzy/Typicality-Based Approaches (pre-2022)
• Fuzzy and possibilistic clustering in IDS:
• Before the recent focus on full Mixture-of-Typicalities (MoT) and large-scale cloud-based deployment, researchers
explored online fuzzy/possibilistic clusterers to provide better robustness to outliers and imbalanced classes.
• These methods typically aimed for greater adaptability and resilience compared to classic k-means or signature-based
IDS, but were mostly limited to batch or small-scale online environments.

2. First Wave: Online/Evolutionary Clustering with Fuzzy/Possibilistic Approaches (2022–2023)
• [1] (2022, Fangqi Li et al., IEEE Trans. Fuzzy Syst.)
• Significance: Incorporates a full Bayesian possibilistic clustering module and ensemble fuzzy classifiers for online IoT
IDS.
• Advances: Dynamic cluster identification, adapts to traffic distribution shifts, ensemble backend for stability and drift
adaptation.
• Limitations: Uses possibilistic clustering (related to MoT but not a true MoT joint membership-typicality optimizer).

Impact: Set a foundation for streaming fuzzy clustering models in online IoT environments, with advances in cluster
adaptation and robustness to evolving streams.
• Distributed streaming anomaly detection (2022–2023):
• Several works pivoted toward integration with distributed stream platforms, e.g., Spark Streaming and Kafka, to handle
the velocity and scale characteristic of IoT data ([5,7,8,10]).

3. Big Data and Real-Time Stream Architectures Become Central (2021–2025)
• Kafka/Spark-based scalable IDS frameworks:
• Studies such as [5,6,7,8,10] demonstrate the uptake of cloud-native tools (Kafka for ingest, Spark for processing) as core
platforms for real-time IDS.
• Emphasis: Achieving high throughput, reproducibility, and low-latency threat detection in realistic settings, rather than
simulation-only environments.
• Methods: Most adopted classical or incremental ML (k-means, KNN, VFDT), but rarely combined with advanced
cluster-typicality or fully evolutionary cluster adaptation.
• Milestone: [8] (2022) stands out for its real-time Spark-Kafka integration with streaming DDoS detection, though it does
not use MoT or evolutionary cluster adaptation mechanisms.
• Latest: [6,10] (2025) underscore a continuing trend toward very-high-throughput platforms, emphasizing scalability, and
adaptive incremental learning, but without deep typicality models.

4. Concept Drift and Class Imbalance: Acknowledgement and Partial Solutions (2022–2024)
• Stream-specific drift and adaptation:
• Researchers recognize and directly tackle concept drift ([2,3,4,9]), with explicit discussion of online drift detectors (KS-test,
DDM, ADWIN, etc.) and mechanisms for retraining or adaptive update on distribution shift.
• Empirical evaluation: Some works such as [3] and [4] evaluate various drift detectors in high-velocity IoT traffic streams,
sometimes using realistic streaming pipelines (e.g., [3] with Spark and Kafka).
• Coverage: Class imbalance is sometimes addressed, but often via straightforward resampling or threshold adjustment,
not via integration with cluster-typicality objectives.
• Trend: Recent studies move toward automatic drift handling and balancing, but seldom within a MoT optimization.

5. Mixture of Typicalities and Joint Membership-Typicality Optimization: Still Emerging
• Absence of fully MoT-based online IDS in high-throughput IoT streams:
• While possibilistic/fuzzy clustering is leveraged ([1]), no paper in this batch demonstrates a real-time evolutionary
clustering IDS for IoT using the full MoT framework (jointly optimizing memberships and typicalities per the MoT objective),
especially not in a heavily cloud-native streaming platform.
• Outlier management and typicality-based anomaly scoring—a signature of MoT—remain rarely implemented in distributed/realtime IoT-ready IDS from this literature set.
• Implication: The field shows a preparatory evolution—from offline/possibilistic clustering to distributed, scalable platforms, with mounting attention to drift and imbalance—yet full realization of MoT in these contexts is, as of this literature,
essentially an open challenge.

6. Edge Deployment and Resource Efficiency: A Growing Consideration
• Edge/Hierarchical focus: Only occasional, often in future work or as conceptual statements (e.g., [6]).
• Metrics Trend: Reporting is improving—some more recent papers record latency, F1, throughput ([6,7,8,10]), but detailed
edge-resource benchmarks (CPU, RAM, energy, real ARM/MCU targets) are rare.

Key Trends and Patterns
• Integration of cloud-native streaming tools (Kafka, Spark, Flink) for IDS is now standard: Initially adopted mainly for batch
or offline studies, recent works increasingly implement and benchmark in real distributed streaming environments ([5,6,7,8,10]).
• Incremental/online clustering is common, but state-of-the-art MoT evolutionary clustering remains rare: Most clustering-based IDS still employ simpler or batch-mode fuzzy/possibilistic clusterers ([1,4]) or classic online clustering (k-means
variants), not the full MoT joint optimization.
• Explicit handling of concept drift and imbalance is recognized as essential: Recent works directly compare and
benchmark drift adaptation strategies ([2,3,4,9]).
• Clear movement toward empirical benchmarking under realistic streaming loads: Fluid event rates, latency and throughput metrics, and big data pipeline orchestration are now often included ([6,7,8,10]).

Scarcity of detailed resource/edge deployment analysis: While edge suitability is highlighted as a need, detailed evaluation
on embedded platforms is rare; usually, this is deferred to future work or assumed on the basis of algorithmic "lightweightness."

Major Contributors and Collaborative Clusters
• No clear repeated clusters of authors or research groups emerge with a dominating thread through this corpus:
• Most impactful works (e.g., [1,8]) appear to be led by separate research teams.
• Some overlap in citations exists ([2] referencing [8]), but there is no obvious sustained multi-year effort by a single group
fully spanning evolutionary clustering, MoT, and high-throughput stream IDS in IoT.
• Individual contributions highlight different facets:
• Fangqi Li et al. ([1]): pushed Bayesian possibilistic clustering and fuzzy ensembles online, focusing on flexibility and drift
adaptation, evaluated on real IoT datasets.
• Patil and Kumar et al. ([8]): innovated in high-throughput, distributed IDS architectures but did not address typicality/MoT-style clustering.
• Synergy across subfields (fuzzy clustering, spark streaming, concept drift) is more common than deep convergence:
Most advances combine technologies but have not synthesized all of them into the target approach (evolutionary MoT in
high-throughput IoT stream IDS).

Conclusions and Future Implications
• Mixture-of-Typicalities (MoT) in streaming IoT IDS is barely explored within realistic, high-throughput cloud/edge frameworks as of 2024. Solutions so far emphasize one or two facets (fuzzy clustering, stream adaptation, cloud scalability), not all
combined.
• Next milestone for the field: A work that unites
• full evolutionary MoT clustering,
• real-time drift/imbalance handling,
• and deployment/evaluation within Kafka/Flink/Spark in large-scale IoT settings,
• including edge-computing benchmarks,
• and classical IDS/ML baselines under rich metrics,
will both fill a research gap and address the most pressing open challenges identified in this literature.
• Research is moving in this direction, with active attention to adaptive streaming, unsupervised anomaly detection, scalability,
and interpretability, but full convergence is yet to be achieved.

Abstract: Although the existing machine learning-based intrusion detection systems in the Internet of Things (IoT) usually perform well in static environments, they
struggle to preserve their performance over time, in dynamic environments. Yet, the IoT is a highly dynamic and heterogeneous environment, leading to what is
known as data drift and concept drift. Data drift is a phenomenon which embodies the change that happens in the relationships among the independent features,
which is mainly due to changes in the data quality over time. Concept drift is a phenomenon which depicts the change in the relationships between input and output
data in...

systems (IDS) are currently an indispensable tool for self-protection against various attacks. However, IoT systems face serious challenges due to the functional
diversity of attacks, resulting in detection methods with machine learning (ML) and limited static models generated by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm.
The process entails adjusting the model parameters in real time as new data arrives. This paper proposes a new method of an IDS based on the LDA algorithm

Abstract: The data collected by sensors is streaming data in the Internet of Things (IoT). Although existing deep-learning-based anomaly detection methods generally
perform well on static data, they struggle to respond timely to streaming data after distribution changes. However, streaming data suffers from conceptual drift due
to the highly dynamic nature of IoT. In network security, concept drift-oriented anomaly detection is a crucial task, because it can adjust the model to adapt to the
latest data, and detect attacks in time. Existing streaming anomaly detection methods are confronted with some challenges, including the latency of model updates,

Abstract: In recent years, significant research has been devoted to the development of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) able to detect anomalous computer
network traffic indicative of malicious activity. While signature-based IDS have proven effective in discovering known attacks, anomaly-based IDS hold the even
greater promise of being able to automatically detect previously undocumented threats. Traditional IDS are generally trained in batch mode, and therefore cannot
adapt to evolving network data streams in real time. To resolve this limitation, data stream mining techniques can be utilized to create a new type of IDS able to
dynamically model a stream of network traffic....

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of Internet of Things (IoT) systems create major challenges for threat detection systems that rely on machine learning models.
Over time, shifts in the statistical distribution of data can lead to drastic performance degradation. This phenomenon is known as concept drift. When this problem

Abstract: Concept drift (CD) in data streaming scenarios such as networking intrusion detection systems (IDS) refers to the change in the statistical distribution of the

Abstract: Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been deployed to monitor network activity and to protect systems and the Internet of Things (IoT)
devices from attacks (or intrusions). The problem with these systems is that they generate a huge amount of inappropriate false alarms whenever abnormal activities
are detected and they are not too flexible for a complex environment. The high-level rate of the generated false alarms reduces the performance of IDS against
cyber-attacks and makes the tasks of the security analyst particularly difficult and the management of intrusion detection process computationally expensive. We

Abstract: Vehicle ad-hoc network (VANET) plays an important role in improving traffic management and driving safety. Data sharing in VANET can be achieved
using such communications as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Cloud (V2C). However, due to the openness of VANET, if
an adversary can access shared data without authorization, it will seriously threaten vehicle safety and user privacy, and bring great challenges to data sharing.
Therefore, it is necessary to establish an efficient access control scheme for secure data sharing in cloud-assisted VANET. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) can
achieve fine-grained access control. However, the traditional access control schemes for VANET rarely...

to and managed by the cloud/edge in an encrypted form which necessitates efficient processing of such encrypted data for real-time anomaly detection. Motivated
by the simultaneous...

Abstract: The need for robust unsupervised anomaly detection techniques in streaming data increases rapidly in today’s era of smart devices. Many existing anomaly
detection methods have difficulties to detect anomalies in streaming data since most of them are designed to use all features of the data which are not applicable in
a streaming context such as IoT. To address this problem, we present a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach (Track Before Detect) for time series data.
Track Before Detect (TBD) is capable of detecting a wide range of anomalies such as point anomalies and collective anomalies. In addition, it can differentiate...

citations.
Not measured Topic Match
Abstract: Both data compression and anomaly detection are very deeply studied areas for the last decades and gain significance for the Internet of Things (IoT),
especially industrial IoT (IIoT). Due to the advantages like fewer latency and security aspects, edge computing is often preferred to cloud solutions. While the amount
of data as well as the demand for edge data processing increases, resources like bandwidth, computational performance, memory and, in case of Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSN), also energy are still limited. This leads primarily to a trade-off between maximum data reduction, information extraction and minimal computational
effort. Often, both data compression...

[174] Visual Structural Assessment and Anomaly Detection for High-Velocity Data Streams
Punit Rathore, ..., and M. Palaniswami. IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 2020. 9 citations.
Not measured Topic Match
Abstract: The widespread use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies, smartphones, and social media services generates huge amounts of data streaming at high
velocity. Automatic interpretation of these rapidly arriving data streams is required for the timely detection of interesting events that usually emerge in the form of
clusters. This article proposes a new relative of the visual assessment of the cluster tendency (VAT) model, which produces a record of structural evolution in the data
stream by building a cluster heat map of the entire processing history in the stream. The existing VAT-based algorithms for streaming data, called inc-VAT/inc-iVAT
and dec-VAT/dec-iVAT, are not...

[175] Fast Anomaly Detection in Multiple Multi-Dimensional Data Streams
Hongyu Sun, ..., and Feifei Chen. 2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), 2019. 19 citations.

Abstract: Multiple multi-dimensional data streams are ubiquitous in the modern world, such as IoT applications, GIS applications and social networks. Detecting
anomalies in such data streams in real-time is an important and challenging task. It is able to provide valuable information from data and then assists
decision-making. However, exiting approaches for anomaly detection in multi-dimensional data streams have not properly considered the correlations among multiple
multi-dimensional streams. Moreover, for multi-dimensional streaming data, online detection speed is often an important concern. In this paper, we propose a fast
yet effective anomaly detection approach in multiple multi-dimensional data streams. This is based on...

Abstract: IoT devices become more integrated into daily life, they are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks, compromising user confidentiality. Although existing
intrusion detection techniques for IoT systems have been developed, they often fail to accurately classify attacks. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting
intrusions in IoT devices by combining advanced feature extraction and deep learning techniques. The proposed method first preprocesses dataset images to
enhance data quality by filtering out irrelevant information. A unique Aquila Optimized Convolutional Neural Network (AOCNN) is then applied to extract optimal
features. The proposed AOCNN incorporates an optimization technique called Aquila Optimizer that finetunes the...

[182] Strategic Network Attack Prevention System Leveraging Sophisticated Query-Based Network Attention Algorithm (QNAA) and Self-Perpetuating Generative Adversarial Network (SPF-GAN) Techniques for Optimal Detection
Tahani Albalawi, ..., and F. Albalwy. Electronics, 2025. 0 citations.

Abstract: Network attack detection is a critical issue in complex networks at present, one which becomes even more challenging as the network complexity grows
and new threats emerge. Existing security models may encounter problems such as low accuracy, a high number of false positives, and the inability to learn new
attacks, especially jamming attacks, where the attacker floods a communication channel with noise. Hence, an adaptive and resilient approach is required. This study
presents two novel approaches—the Query-Based Network Attention Algorithm (QNAA) and the Self-Perpetuating Generative Adversarial Network (SPF-GAN) —to
enhance performance and flexibility. The QNAA integrates attention mechanisms that allow...

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised increasing concern about targeted cyber attacks. Previous research primarily focused on
static Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which employ offline training to safeguard IoT systems. However, such static IDSs struggle with real-world scenarios
where IoT system behaviors and attack strategies can undergo rapid evolution, necessitating dynamic and adaptable IDSs. In response to this challenge, we
propose AOC-IDS, a novel online IDS that features an autonomous anomaly detection module (ADM) and a labor-free online framework for continual adaptation.
In order to enhance data comprehension, the ADM employs an Autoencoder (AE) with...
