## 🧠 KEY DECISIONS LOG

### Decision 001: Development System Architecture (2025-11-08)
**Context:** Project delayed, need to accelerate development while maximizing learning
**Decision:** Implement automated documentation system with:
- 9 specialized skills for research context
- 4 hooks for auto-save, session recovery, weekly reports
- Iterative learning approach (concept → code → experiment → repeat)
- Weekly sprints aligned with advisor meetings

**Rationale:**
- 10-20h/week requires high efficiency
- Terminal crashes require protection against data loss
- Flexible meeting dates need continuous report generation
- Learning from scratch (clustering + streaming) needs guided approach

**Impact:** Expected 2-3x acceleration in development speed

## 💾 RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS

**If session crashes or you need to resume:**

1. Open new Claude Code session
2. Type: `/resume` OR "Continue from SESSION_CONTEXT.md"
3. Claude will read this file and present current status
4. Auto-save hook protects against data loss (commits every 10min to wip/auto-save)

**If auto-save branch exists:**
- Claude will ask if you want to recover from interrupted session
- Say "yes" to continue from last saved state
