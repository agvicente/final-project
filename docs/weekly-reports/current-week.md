**Phase:** Preparation → Fase 2
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress

---

## 📊 Week Overview

**Goal:** Configure development acceleration system for research

**Planned Activities:**
- Set up automated documentation system
- Create research-specific skills
- Configure protection hooks
- Test complete workflow

## 💻 Code & Implementation

### Session 2025-11-08
**Duration:** In progress
**Focus:** System architecture and initial setup

**What Was Implemented:**
- Created folder structure for documentation
- Created SESSION_CONTEXT.md (project brain)
- Started skill and hook creation

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - Master context file
- `docs/weekly-reports/current-week.md` - This file
- `.claude/` directories - Skills and hooks structure

**Technical Decisions:**
- Use SESSION_CONTEXT.md as permanent project state
- Auto-save every 10min to wip/auto-save branch
- Continuous weekly report generation (not just Fridays)

## 🧠 Insights & Learning

### Understanding the System
- SESSION_CONTEXT.md serves as project memory across all sessions
- Hooks provide automation without interrupting workflow
- Skills provide just-in-time learning for complex topics

### Research Strategy
- 30% theory / 60% practice / 10% review distribution
- Weekly sprints aligned with advisor meetings
- Iterative learning: small concept → implement → experiment → repeat
